    "# PointObject: Analysing pipeline for localisation super-resolution data\n",
    "----\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "PointObject was developed to analyse point localisation super-resolution data. The raw input to the pipeline are the localisations as generated by softwares like rapidstorm or others. The implementation in IPython notebooks should aid in documentation of the analysis steps and will hopefully make the workflow as convenient as possible. This example file is intented to be used as template for the analysis of new measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following a short description of the workflow will be given and one short example will be analysed. The functions itself will be described in place and further documentation can be found by looking at the source code itself."
